## Cand Bamp

### Description and Motivation
We wanted to create a space where artists could talk about and share their art. Taking this core idea and adding onto it as we go, we had the plan to make something akin to BandCamp.com, only our iteration of it. Users should be able to:
    1.) Artists should be able to post their music and blog posts about them
    2.) Users should be able to comment on artist's blog posts
    3.) There are two basic account types: "Listeners" and "Artists"
    4.) Listeners and Artists should be able to "like" different posts (Music, article, album, etc.)
    5.) Artists and Articles with the most likes will create a Featured Page

### Prior Art
There's so much blog post website that exist on the internet, but this website is built mostly for artists. The user view the artist post and like them. We want to built our own website to inspire artist to display their music to the platform.

### Core User Workflows
- Signup: The user will have an option to signup as a artist or a listener.
- Artist: They should be able to create, edit and delete blog posts, which may be just a text post, single, or album for streaming. They can also listen to other artists and also rate their album and leave reviews or comments about their page. Also they can follow other Artists.
- Listenr: They will be able to like and comment on the artist's blog posts. Also they can follow the Artist.
- Artist's music will be featured on the featured page.


### Daily Goals
 - Tuesday: Have a successful signup (creating the basic model, view, and form, plus admin features on these features.). Users should be able to make an account that is either a "listener" or "artist". Both user types have the same accessibility, but each role's ability has different names and emphasis for features. The artist, is essence, has one more ability the listener does not: The ability to post their music.

 - Wednesday: Finish up previous work on signup, and begin the featured or home page. Featured page will have, at this point, artists, articles, and suggested with the same favorite genres.

 - Thursday: We want to implement user authentication for the user and artist. Both roles have different layout.

 - Friday: Listeners and Artists should be able to make their own page on the site, with a small description, their favorite artists, and favorite articles from our site.

 - Monday: Assess where we are in the project, finish what needs to be finished in last week's work. After this, we will start on the css and look of each template.
