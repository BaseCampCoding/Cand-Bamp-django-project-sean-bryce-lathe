## Cand Bamp

### Description and Motivation
We wanted to create a space where artists could talk about and share their art. Taking this core idea and adding onto it as we go, we had the plan to make something akin to BandCamp.com, only our iteration of it. Users should be able to:
    1.) Artists should be able to post their music and blog posts about them
    2.) Users should be able to comment on artist's blog posts
    3.) There are two basic account types: "Listeners" and "Artists"
    4.) Listeners and Artists should be able to "like" different posts (Music, article, album, etc.)
    5.) Artists and Articles with the most likes will create a Featured Page

### Prior Art
There's so much blog post website that exist on the internet, but this website is built mostly for artists. The user view the artist post and like them. We want to built our own website to inspire artist to display their music to the platform.

### Core User Workflows
- 

### Daily Goals
 - Tuesday: Have a successful signup. Users should be able to make an account that is either a "listener" or 
 "artist". Both user types have the same accessibility, but each role's ability has different names for features. The artist, is essence, has one more ability the listener does not: The ability to post their music.

 - Wednesday: Finish up previous work on signup, and begin the featured or home page. Featured page will have, at this point, artist.

 - Thursday: We want to implement user authentication for the user and artist. Both roles have different layout.
