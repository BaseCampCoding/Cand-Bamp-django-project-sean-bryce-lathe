## Cand Bamp

### Description and Motivation
We wanted to create a space where artists could talk about and share their art. Taking this core idea and adding onto it as we go, we had the plan to make something akin to BandCamp.com, only our iteration of it. Users should be able to:
    1.) Artists should be able to post their music and blog posts about them
    2.) Users should be able to comment on artist's blog posts
